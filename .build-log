[19:45:33]   Idea: Skanzer - Claude Code skill security scanner. Upload skill markdown files or scan skill directories. Detects: 1) Data exfiltration (HTTP calls, file writes outside workspace, env var access), 2) Behavior vs description mismatches (parse skill actions vs stated purpose), 3) Privilege escalation (sudo, dangerous bash commands). Dashboard shows scan results with severity ratings, detailed findings, and safe/unsafe skill counts. Uses static analysis on markdown to find suspicious patterns.
